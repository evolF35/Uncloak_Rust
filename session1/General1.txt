6.  Suppose you read about RSA encryption and wanted to find 
it’s standard specification. Where would you look?

7.  Find two libraries for each of RSA, TLS/SSL, and AEAD. 
Evaluate the maturity each library, and skim the code. 
What about the library structure makes sense? 
How is their documentation? These links may help:
https://cryptography.rs/
https://lib.rs/ 
(librs is equivalent to crates.io, with a different interface)


8.  Benchmark the speed of an algorithm in the 
two different implementations with Criterion.



9.  You’re implementing a Tweakable Encryption scheme. 
You need to know what standard API users will expect. 
Find a reference for the standard API and 
write the function signatures for encryption and decryption.

10. You want to understand a paper on a 
new polynomial commitment scheme, 
but you’ve been trying for more than an hour, 
and the math is over your head. What do you do?

11. Implement the Vignère cipher in 100 lines or less.



12. What is a side channel attack? 
Is your cipher implementation constant time?

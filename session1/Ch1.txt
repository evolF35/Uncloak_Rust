1.  Q10. Describe a concrete example where improving the security of a system against 
one type of attack can increase the likelihood of other attacks.

Lets say you build a large metal fence around your house to stop burglars. 

Well the burglars now instead steal you fence around you house. 


lets say you have a password for a certain login. 
to have more security, you lock it in a box or device with another password attached. 

ie if you lock P1 in a box. You have another password P2 to get into the box. 

now you have to worry about protecting P2. 

idk next question.

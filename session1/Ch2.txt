Ch 2:

2.  Q3. Consider a group of 30 people who wish to establish 
pair-wise secure communications using symmetric-key cryptography. 
How many keys need to be exchanged in total.

30 people 
each person generates a key with 29 other people
there are 30 people
so 30*29 
but no, if P1 generates a key P17, then P17 does not need to for P1 
so (30*29)/2 

so 435 keys. 


3.  Q4. Suppose Bob receives a messages signed 
using a digital signature scheme with Aliceâ€™s secret signing key. 
Does it prove that Alice saw the message and chose to sign.

nope, she could have been hacked.


4.  Q6. Suppose a chosen-ciphertext attacker cannot 
recover the secret decryption key for an encryption scheme. 
Does this mean the encryption scheme is secure?

no , still leak info about message

5.  Q7. Consider a symmetric-key cryptosystem in which 
cryptographic keys are randomly selected from the 
set of all n-bit strings. 
Approximately what should n be in order to 
provide 128 bits of security against a birthday attack.

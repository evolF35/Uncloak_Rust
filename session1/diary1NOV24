Ok so I think I done for this week

i did not do well . 

I procastinated for 1. 
I also believe In future weeks I should read the chapter, then do 
the exercises. 

in this week I read the chapters before, and once I started the exercises I 
felt all the info was gone. 
ie i read before the class, saw the HW, then procastinated in doing the HW 

Now would rather do, go to class, see the HW, read the Chapters, do HW repeat.

However all is not lost, I copied the code for vegnere and became more familiar with 
Rust. 

ie I ran the main file with the vegnere program I copied from Thor and it compiled

So future lessons is reading then do HW.
